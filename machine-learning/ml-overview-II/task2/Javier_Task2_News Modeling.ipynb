There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent.

However, the rumors\\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\n>seems more likely.\\n\\nYo Ken, let\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n', '14': \"From: jllee@acsu.buffalo.edu (Johnny L Lee)\\nSubject: RE:  == MOVING SALE ===\\nSummary: RE:  === MOVING SALE ===\\nOrganization: UB\\nLines: 44\\nNntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu\\n\\nReduced Prices! \\nI have a list of things forsale on behalf of my brother, who's moving (moved\\nalready)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOffer:\\n1) Black and Decker Duster Plus (Portable Hand Vaccum)\\t\\n \\tpurchased for $32, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $12\\n\\n2) SR-1000 Dual Cassette Portable Player, AM/FM\\n5-Band graphics Equalizer, high speed dubing, Duo \\nTape.Tape deck A, seems to have lost treble sound. \\nBut, I bet  it's fixable.\\n\\tpurchased for $80\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $25\\n\\n3)Monolux Zoom MicroScope, up to 1200X magnification\\nMade in Japan, includes case and accessories\\n\\tpurchased for $50\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $20\\n\\n4)Sunbeam 1400 Hair Dryer, the dryer you put your \\nhead under/into.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....

Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n>\\n>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\\n>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\\n>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.

There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent.

However, the rumors\\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\n>seems more likely.\\n\\nYo Ken, let\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n', '14': \"From: (Johnny L Lee)\\nSubject: RE:  == MOVING SALE ===\\nSummary: RE:  === MOVING SALE ===\\nOrganization: UB\\nLines: 44\\nNntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu\\n\\nReduced Prices! \\nI have a list of things forsale on behalf of my brother, who's moving (moved\\nalready)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOffer:\\n1) Black and Decker Duster Plus (Portable Hand Vaccum)\\t\\n \\tpurchased for $32, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $12\\n\\n2) SR-1000 Dual Cassette Portable Player, AM/FM\\n5-Band graphics Equalizer, high speed dubing, Duo \\nTape.Tape deck A, seems to have lost treble sound. \\nBut, I bet  it's fixable.\\n\\tpurchased for $80\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $25\\n\\n3)Monolux Zoom MicroScope, up to 1200X magnification\\nMade in Japan, includes case and accessories\\n\\tpurchased for $50\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  $20\\n\\n4)Sunbeam 1400 Hair Dryer, the dryer you put your \\nhead under/into.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\\ntoo!)\\n\\nIf this post had gone the other way, I\\'d be arguing for revolvers. :-)\\n\\nRick.\\n', '40': 'From:  (Sean Garrison)\\nSubject: Re: Bonilla\\nNntp-Posting-Host: berkeley-kstar-node.net.yale.edu\\nOrganization: Yale Univeristy\\nLines: 37\\n\\nIn article (theodore r krueger) wrote:\\n \\n> Isn\\'t it funny that  a white person calls comeone a \"nigger\" and gets banned \\n> for a year, but a black person calls someone a \"faggot\" and there is no \\n> consequence?\\n\\n> Ted\\n\\n\\nTed, you\\'re missing a vital point.

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall, though.As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).>>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to>argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the \"createdin His image\" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphorsunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that wayinitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) butyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.David.---On religion:\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through.', '12': 'From: (Rod Cerkoney)Subject: *$G4qxF,fekVH6Nntp-Posting-Host: hpfcmrc.fc.hp.comOrganization: Hewlett Packard, Fort Collins, COX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.5]Lines: 15--Regards,Rod Cerkoney                                                        /______________________________________________         /~~                                                      /      Rod Cerkoney MS 37     email:                      /         Hewlett Packard                /  /            3404 East Harmony Rd.

However, the rumors>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter>seems more likely.Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option \"A\" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option \"B\" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options \"A\" and \"B\".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.Option C - Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diametercylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against    micrometeroid & orbital debris)  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)  - 7 berthing ports  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet    (twice the volume of skylab).  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors  - 10 kW of housekeeping power  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)  - increased crew time for utilization  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module', '14': \"From: (Johnny L Lee)Subject: RE:  == MOVING SALE ===Summary: RE:  === MOVING SALE ===Organization: UBLines: 44Nntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.eduReduced Prices!

You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the    same inquiry as you.     Age: 24 (then and now)    Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD    Driving Record: Clean    State: Illinois    Cost: $820/6 mos.     I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.     I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more    than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.     Hope the info helps.

You take away all he hastand all he's ever gonna have.\"ttt--Will Munny, \"Unforgiven\"======================================================================== 61 I am beyond the \"under 25\" age group, but I have an experience a fewyears ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a 1985 Toyota CelicaGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runnersincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was lessmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxurycar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but idecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I askedabout what would happen to my rate with either car. \"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same asthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for thatyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase becausethe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continueto handle your account. \"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go witha 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,but cancel you after that.\" \"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actuallyfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"  That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  Forsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -as very traditional and conservative.\" I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porschedealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressureguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have takena year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  Iconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of autotheft.    /|/| /||)|/  /~ /| ||)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.  / | |/ |||  _|/|_|/|)[_|_|  |      is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======     ======================================================================== 32 I live in Idaho.

Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industrythat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it'smore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the systemas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.         Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but theyusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of theway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".         Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing whenthe water boils.

Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.I see two facets of a response to it:1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not   constitute what the Apostle Paul called \"becoming all things to all men so   that by all possible means I might save some.\"   Don't say \"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time   on.\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not   creator.

Furthermore, its promotion asproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as faras it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goalof letting LE wiretap \"terrorists and drug dealers\" is to restrictstronger techniques.  Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can betapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryptionclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will theintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strongprivacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a systemexpressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  Themere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretappingcapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domesticcryptography, and only by this restriction.  \"Clipper\" appears to beno more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  Wewould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the publicat large will not care.

Itis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  Onthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over theyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had highprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from secondsto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder fromturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happenwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sortsof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or ablow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Manyof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi autotake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likelyto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fallinto that category.Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposingview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The SemiAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and selfdefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclinationthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semiauto effectively as a self defense arm.Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the departmentisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on theirown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount oftraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably severaltimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pickwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that dayand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking ofbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get aRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are oktoo!)If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)Rick.', '40': 'From:  (Sean Garrison)Subject: Re: BonillaNntp-Posting-Host: berkeley-kstar-node.net.yale.eduOrganization: Yale UniveristyLines: 37In article (theodore r krueger) wrote: > Isn't it funny that  a white person calls comeone a \"nigger\" and gets banned > for a year, but a black person calls someone a \"faggot\" and there is no > consequence?> TedTed, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in aprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball wasbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner ona constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be adifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have tohire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who isan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Metsgame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended frombaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,that's downright ludicrous.

Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado haspitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next loweston the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in thetlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners andtwould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there'stanother curve approaching)3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal istdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  moderntelectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light abouttto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on astlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileagethan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember thatthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes abig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear touse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with aninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a5 speed)?  how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the bestgear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there willbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic withall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to dobetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were provedwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, highrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple ifone sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.eliot', '57': \"From: (David R.

Im not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall, though.As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).>>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we>are supposed to live by Christs example, you would be hard pressed to>argue that God is a \"do what I say, not what I do\" kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the \"createdin His image\" means. Ive heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphorsunashamedly!) As to living by Christs example, we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that wayinitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) butyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.David.---On religion:\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through., 12: From: (Rod Cerkoney)Subject: *$G4qxF,fekVH6Nntp-Posting-Host: hpfcmrc.fc.hp.comOrganization: Hewlett Packard, Fort Collins, COX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.5]Lines: 15--Regards,Rod Cerkoney                                                        /______________________________________________         /~~                                                      /      Rod Cerkoney MS 37     email:                      /         Hewlett Packard                /  /            3404 East Harmony Rd.

However, the rumors>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter>seems more likely.Yo Ken, lets keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Todays (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat OConnor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intodays Times).Option \"A\" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed thats     qualified for STS and ELVs. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option \"B\" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options \"A\" and \"B\".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.Option C - Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diametercylinder thats 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors, and launch the can.

I owned a 1985 Toyota CelicaGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runnersincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was lessmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxurycar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but idecided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way.  I askedabout what would happen to my rate with either car. \"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same asthe Celica (the 85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for thatyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase becausethe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continueto handle your account. \"If you buy the Porsche 924, well have to change you to the standard[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go witha 944, its another story again - well cover the rest of this year,but cancel you after that.\" \"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actuallyfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doenst make sense.\"  Thats what the book says.  We dont insure Corvettes, either.  Forsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -as very traditional and conservative.\" I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porschedealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressureguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have takena year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  Iconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of autotheft.    /|/| /||)|/  /~ /| ||)[~|)/~   |   Everyones entitled to MY opinion.  / | |/ |||  _|/|_|/|)[_|_|  |      is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======     ======================================================================== 32 I live in Idaho.

Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (Theres a gripe in the industrythat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So itsmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the systemas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.         Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but theyusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of theway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".         Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing whenthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.tttttJohn Nagle, 27: \"From: (Doug Roberts)Subject: Re: NL vs. AL?Organization: University of Arizona, Biotechnology, TucsonLines: 2NNTP-Posting-Host: joplin.biosci.arizona.eduKeywords: Game lengthDoug Roberts - Ken Hill for NL MVP!!t       Lets go Spos\", 28: From: (Jonathan Hayward)Subject: Re: Pantheism & EnvironmentalismOrganization: Wheaton College, ILLines: 46In article (Gary V.

Itis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesnt cost you much.  Onthe other hand, Ive had all sorts of interesting things happen over theyears.  For example, Ive had FACTORY ammunition that has had highprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from secondsto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.Ive had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder fromturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happenwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.Most revolvers are more fragile then semi autos.  There are all sortsof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or ablow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Manyof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi autotake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likelyto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, youre out of the fight.The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fallinto that category.Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposingview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoobs \"The SemiAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"In general, Id agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and selfdefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclinationthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semiauto effectively as a self defense arm.Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the departmentisnt going to train them, they arent going to take the time on theirown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount oftraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably severaltimes that of a revolver.  Many cops dont bother.For myself, Id hate to be limited to one or the other.  Id rather pickwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what Im wearing that dayand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking ofbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get aRuger or Smith revolver....

As Roger Lustig pointed out in aprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball wasbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner ona constant basis.

Pallone is hoping for a years suspension.  In my opinion,thats downright ludicrous.

Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. Hows this for numbers? Maldanado haspitched three scoreless innings and Navarros ERA is 0.75. The next loweston the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!It doesnt look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the teams only HR, at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, its not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, its early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in thetlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners andtwould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when therestanother curve approaching)3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal istdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  moderntelectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light abouttto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on astlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileagethan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember thatthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes abig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear touse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with aninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a5 speed)?  how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the bestgear to use is for every conceivable situation?  im sure there willbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic withall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to dobetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were provedwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, highrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple ifone sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.eliot, 57: \"From: (David R.
